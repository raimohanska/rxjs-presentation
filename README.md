Reactive Extensions For JavaScript
==================================

A Presentation originally held at Reaktor DevDay on 2011-09-02
--------------------------------------------------------------

This repo contains all the material I've prepared for the presentation.
I'm writing this readme for you to use as a landing spot after the
presentation. I hope these links can get you started on RxJs, the sad
fact being that currently there's no useful official page to get you
there. I got a word from the RxJs team that they're working on a new
release that will fix is, so let's hope for the best.

### Download ###

Even this part is a bit complicated. I hope you can get it from [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/devlabs/ff628422.aspx).

### API docs ###

Will be contained in the downloaded zip file in the Windows Help File
Format (.chm). On a Mac, you can use iChm to view that adequately.

Alternatively you can use an HTML converted version that my colleague
published [here](http://eea.kapsi.fi/RXJS/).
